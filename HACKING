This document gives a quick overview on how to compile and package tilda.

Building the software locally
=============================

If you have checked out tilda from git, then the following steps
will give you an idea of how to compile tilda:

 * Run the autogen.sh script (if necessary make it executable first):
       ./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr
 * make

Now you can start hacking and develop new features or fix bugs. When
you are finished commit your changes. Then go to the next section
and create a package.

Building a package
==================

In order to build a package which can be uploaded to some
Debian based distribution the following steps are necessary.
Replace '#' with the number of the current minor release.

 1. Check out the latest stable branch (e.g. tilda-1-1)
   and commit any changes or patches which you want to include,
   then commit these changes.
 2. Update the changelog with a message such as:
       "Update the change log for 1.1.#"
 3. Update the version number in configure.ac and make
   a commit with the version number:
       "1.1.#"
 4. Rebase the tilda-debian-1-1 ontop of the latest stable HEAD.
   This is not very nice currently as this branch needs to be
   rebased every time a new release is made. I am still looking
   for a better solution.
 5. Change debian/changelog and update the Debian specific changelog.
 6. Create a tarball using git-archive:
        git archive --prefix=tilda-1.1.#/ -o ../tilda_1.1.#.orig.tar.gz HEAD

You now have a tarball which can be build into a package. The following steps
are just to document the basic commands that are required to build the package,
then verify its correct and upload the package to mentors. However the steps which
are required to setup such a development environment are not explained here:

 7. cd ..; tar -xf tilda_1.1.#.orig.tar.gz
 8. cd tilda-1.1.#
 9. Run debuild
10. If debuild finishes without a problem next run pbuilder, this will verify that
    the packge is buildable (without warnings or errors) in a clean environment:
        sudo pbuilder --build --basetgz ~/pbuilder/unstable-base.tgz tilda_1.1.8-1.dsc
11. If pbuilder does not complain and you don't see any warnings in lintian, then
    upload the package to mentors:
        dput mentors tilda_1.1.#-1_amd64.changes
